   MULTI-INSTANCE FILE LOCKING
   ============================================================
   If two people run this program at the same time (two terminals,
   two instances sharing the same data folder), each instance reads
   every file into memory at startup and rewrites the whole file on
   save. Without locking, two saves close together can interleave or
   one can silently overwrite the other's changes. openLocked/
   closeLocked wrap fopen/fclose with an OS-level file lock so a
   save from one instance blocks a save (or a load) from another
   until it's done. On POSIX (Linux/macOS) this uses flock(); on
   Windows it falls back to plain fopen/fclose (no lock), so this
   protection only currently applies on POSIX systems. */
